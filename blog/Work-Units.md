# What Are Work Units?
The easiest way to describe a Work Unit is as follows: A unit of energy which denotes how much cognitive and structural load required to execute an event or task.

# Alternatives to Work Units
(AKA: Why didn't the alternatives work? How do we fix that to make a system built for the greater good?)
Work units are inspired by two main, competing analogies used within the disability community: Christine Miserandino's concept of the 'spoon theory,' and the 'battery analogy' which, as far as my knowledge, was not coined by one member of the disability community but was independently created across disparate chronic illness forums as smartphone and battery-oriented technology became more prevalent. This section discusses why both of these theories are useful, but not useful enough for the context in which Work Units are employed.
