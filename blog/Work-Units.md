# What Are Work Units?
The easiest way to describe a Work Unit is as follows: A unit of energy which denotes how much cognitive and structural load required to execute an event or task.

# Alternatives to Work Units
**(AKA: Why didn't the alternatives work? How do we fix that to make a system built for the greater good?)**

Work units are inspired by two main, competing analogies used within the disability community: Christine Miserandino's concept of the 'spoon theory,' and the 'battery analogy' which, as far as my knowledge, was not coined by one member of the disability community but was independently created across disparate chronic illness forums as smartphone and battery-oriented technology became more prevalent. This section discusses why both of these theories are useful, but not useful enough for the context in which Work Units are employed. Spoons and battery percentages are **not deterministic enough**, **don't have the proper structure to be used by machines and humans**, and otherwise are unfit for purpose because of **the need to explain the analogy in a concise manner.** A Work Unit is also not *just* for disabled people. Anyone, at any time, is welcome to use the Work Unit spec. 

## Spoon Theory
With all due respect to the late Miserandino, the spoon theory is great as a beginning introduction to the world of capacity management and fatigue. However, for more expansive models, the spoon theory just does not work. How many spoons does one start with? 10? 20? 1,000? I can't imagine tracking that consistently. The analogy also doesn't have as long of a reach as Work Units do. The original analogy only talks of borrowing a spoon from the 'next day.' What happens if you are continually borrowing spoons? Is there a way to regain spoons that one has lost? Conjectures like this are, well, improvised and thought out for specific in-the-moment benefit, and in the long term don't have accountability or tracking. 

It's a powerful explanatory tool still used by many disabled and chronically ill people, so I don't want to disparage it.

## Battery Analogy
This analogy used to be the one that I used to describe my capacity needs before I devised Work Units. It makes inherent sense, is easy to explain to anyone who's familiar with a smart battery-powered device, and accounts for recharge activities. It has the same issue as spoon theory, though, in that it lacks long-term foresight. The 'context window,' so to speak, is only a few days, if not a week at most. This works for people whose lives are cyclical and/or otherwise needing to plan in the short-term because of the inevitability of flare-ups or other illness-related symptoms and issues.

# How to Use Work Units
Work Unit allocations follow a fairly simple process:
1. [Identify your tasks](#identify-your-tasks)
2. Assess your tasks
3. Calculate Work Unit disbursement and accrual
4. Weekly/monthly recap

## Identify your tasks
This is the hardest part of the entire Work Unit process. What are the **recurring**, **visible tasks** in your life? 
This could include:
- Work shifts
- Academic obligations (lectures, known weekly quizzes, etc.)
- Volunteer or personal recurring obligations (church, errands)
- Travel

The Work Unit system also allows for recovery tracking and long-range planning, so ensure that you include tasks that refill you, such as:
- Time to work on your hobbies or special interests
- Seeing friends
- Time off

Work Units aren't meant to maximize productivity at one's personal expense. Instead, Work Units are meant to help you allocate your time and energy to the things that mean the most, while still being able to balance mandatory tasks and obligations.
