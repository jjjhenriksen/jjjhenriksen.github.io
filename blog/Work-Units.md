# What Are Work Units?
The easiest way to describe a Work Unit is as follows: A unit of energy which denotes how much cognitive and structural load is required to execute an event or task.

# Alternatives to Work Units
**(AKA: Why didn't the alternatives work? How do we fix that to make a system built for the greater good?)**

Work units are inspired by two main, competing analogies used within the disability community: Christine Miserandino's concept of the 'spoon theory,'[^1] and the 'battery analogy'[^2] which, as far as my knowledge, was not coined by one member of the disability community but was independently created across disparate chronic illness forums as smartphone and battery-oriented technology became more prevalent. This section discusses why both of these theories are useful, but not useful enough for the context in which Work Units are employed. Spoons and battery percentages are **not deterministic enough**, **don't have the proper structure to be used by machines and humans**, and otherwise are unfit for purpose because of **the need to explain the analogy in a concise manner.** A Work Unit is also not *just* for disabled people. Anyone, at any time, is welcome to use the Work Unit spec. 

## Spoon Theory
With all due respect to the late Miserandino, the spoon theory is great as a beginning introduction to the world of capacity management and fatigue. However, for more expansive models, the spoon theory just does not work. How many spoons does one start with? 10? 20? 1,000? I can't imagine tracking that consistently. The analogy also doesn't have as long of a reach as Work Units do. The original analogy only talks of borrowing a spoon from the 'next day.' What happens if you are continually borrowing spoons? Is there a way to regain spoons that one has lost? Conjectures like this are, well, improvised and thought out for specific in-the-moment benefit, and in the long term don't have accountability or tracking. 

It's a powerful explanatory tool still used by many disabled and chronically ill people, so I don't want to disparage it.

## Battery Analogy
This analogy used to be the one that I used to describe my capacity needs before I devised Work Units. It makes inherent sense, is easy to explain to anyone who's familiar with a smart battery-powered device, and accounts for recharge activities. It has the same issue as spoon theory, though, in that it lacks long-term foresight. The 'context window,' so to speak, is only a few days, if not a week at most. This works for people whose lives are cyclical and/or otherwise needing to plan in the short-term because of the inevitability of flare-ups or other illness-related symptoms and issues.

# How to Use Work Units
Work Unit allocations follow a fairly simple process:
1. [Identify your tasks](#identify-your-tasks)
2. [Assess your tasks](#assess-your-tasks)
3. [Calculate Work Unit disbursement and accrual](#calculate-work-unit-disbursement-and-accrual)
    - [Daily sustainability](#what-is-the-sustainable-range-of-work-units-one-should-spend-or-complete-in-one-day)
4. [Weekly/monthly recap](#weekly-or-monthly-recap)

## Identify your tasks
This is the hardest part of the entire Work Unit process. What are the **recurring**, **visible tasks** in your life? 
This could include:
- Work shifts
- Academic obligations (lectures, known weekly quizzes, etc.)
- Volunteer or personal recurring obligations (church, errands)
- Travel

The Work Unit system also allows for recovery tracking and long-range planning. Ensure that you include tasks that refill you, such as:
- Time to work on your hobbies or special interests
- Seeing friends
- Scheduled time off

Work Units aren't meant to maximize productivity at one's personal expense. Instead, Work Units are meant to help you allocate your time and energy to the things that mean the most, while still being able to balance mandatory tasks and obligations.

## Assess your tasks
A Work Unit (WU) represents thirty minutes of ideal work. “Ideal work” means work performed under low sensory, social, and external cognitive load. For me, this means a quiet environment with minimal interruptions and high autonomy. For you, “ideal” may look different — but it must be consistent. This definition is now the baseline for which all Work Units will be allocated for your tasks. A task’s Work Unit allocation reflects how many thirty-minute blocks of ideal work it consumes in **structural impact** — *not* in clock time. 

Examples of different tasks and their Work Unit allocations:
- A 75-minute lecture takes up 13 work units because of the higher cognitive load required to absorb information and take notes.
- Social obligations can consume up to 24 work units depending on length, sensory capacity, and political maneuvering.
- A thirty-minute drive in heavy traffic may consume more than one work unit due to travel fatigue.
- A high-visibility 45-minute presentation may cost more than a 90-minute lecture. 

Concretely, the most important part of allocating work units is knowing, conceptually, that time doesn't equal work units. Two activities of identical duration may have radically different structural costs. 

 For example, there are activities that can even *give* you work units, restoring your capacity to do deep work later:
- Working on a passion project or researching a special interest
- Low-demand social activity with trusted friends
- (Pretending to) read a book while holding a mug of tea.

After your first allocations, assessment becomes a structural exercise. 
Questions to ask yourself when allocating work units:
- How far is this task from ideal conditions?
- How much context-switching, evaluation pressure, and other cognitive load is present?
- Is there a sensory load that you need to account for?
- Is the task meant to support your recovery?

# Footnotes
[^1]: The ‘spoon theory’ is as follows: take a set amount of units of energy (in the original analogy, spoons off of every cafe table within the vicinity of the author and her friend’s conversation), and lay them out in a row. These ‘spoons’ now represent the amount of energy that a disabled person has for the day. Each task will take up a set amount of ‘spoons’; once you are out of spoons for the day, you can choose to borrow from the next day to do more tasks, but know that the next day will have less energy to perform a task. (Henriksen, 2025, written for a Disability Studies in-class essay) [Link to the (archived) original essay for further reading.](https://web.archive.org/web/20191117210039/https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/)
[^2]: The battery analogy has been used by many chronic illness and disability communities, so there is not one 'true' explanation. The analogy I had previously found to be useful personally: Each person starts with a fully charged battery. The capacity of the battery, much like your smartphone, is degraded for those of us with a disability. It therefore follows that the battery will deplete faster when completing daily activities. Once your battery reaches 0%, you have to complete recovery activities to charge your battery.
