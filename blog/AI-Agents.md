# Thoughts on AI/AI Agents in general
How I feel about AI in general: It's a tool. Like every tool, one needs to use it properly. Also like every tool, one needs to get to the point where they aren't relying on it. If you use it improperly, it's going to kill your skills of reasoning and thinking. A person should not be afraid to have the AI challenge them on things. One should not be afraid to expand their point of view; but also, stick to what they believe in, and not let a language model lead them towards views they don't believe are morally or ethically right. 

I believe AI is the next great equaliser in assistive technology. AI can simplify or structure language in more accessible ways, allow text-to-speech and speech-to-text to be enabled at a greater and more natural capacity, among many other things. Personally, AI is my sounding board and a part of my capacity management system. It allows me to do things I love and know the costs so that recovery is possible and more efficient. Yes, I do rely on an LLM every day (!) to devise what I'm doing for the day, but I can still reconstruct that same information later. I know exactly what's going into the LLM as inputs and what's coming out as outputs. I use AI to make many things easier on myself, that I can do myself, but choose not to because of the immense emotional or cognitive load that those tasks possess.

# The Work Unit System
For a further explanation of how the system works, feel free to see [my blog post on the topic](Work-Units.md). 

# Transition to OpenClaw
This is also going to be a full blog post, particularly about the setup and how I have set up the workflow. However, I do want to go into some general amount of detail about *why* I chose to migrate to OpenClaw for the personal system.
